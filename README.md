iOS App to help keep track of stuff i'm working on

Some upcoming goals for the project

TODO (in order of priority):

- set up backend that stores longterm text sequence associations (another git repo for this)
- send frontend stored text associations to backend
- frontend requests subset of backend stored text associations
- if frontend does not have an immediate response to a text input, request a backend response for associated text input
- dynamically categorize subsets of text association and have the frontend request text associations by category depending on frontend input context
- schedule a job that processes backend stored text associations to distill "essential" text association groups and prune unneeded text entries
